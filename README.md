# Raspberry-pi-VR
This project allows anyone with a raspberry pi and $300 to create their own lighthouse track vr headset using several software and steamvr dependencies as I just said you will need a pc capable of running vr for me a gtx 1060 6gb and a razen 3 4100 is enough for the project I will give you the instructions to follow below
1. Things you'll need:
You'll need a 3D printer (you can find one on eBay for $100), a PC capable of running VR and time.
2. buy the different parts:
a raspberry pi 4 at least 2gb of ram here is a link to get some https://www.kubii.com/en/nano-computers/2771-raspberry-pi-4-model-b-2gb-5056561800332.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22521945089&gbraid=0AAAAApc7Y9mLVbye3ZxcucaYQkDJoqCpY&gclid=Cj0KCQjw9O_BBhCUARIsAHQMjS4RG0_S2pPgrAOO9RTvORaFUgDZneCOPqlCCog575-CZGT-LK1Lwa8aAoLSEALw_wcB, an sd card of at least 32gb a link to get some https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MicroSDHC-Memory-Adapter-Approved/dp/B08GY9NYRM/ref=sr_1_6_mod_primary_new?adgrpid=55600119749&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vRRteS1syrRQ4bNYx6_9cd59D1VFxzZxv85RwTUOQkHgHV2qXg, a 3.5 inch screen max here is the screen that I personally used https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DRF9Q566/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A31ODO8OD3XQQH&psc=1, a vr headset like this one (we will just take the lenses) https://www.amazon.com/NK-Lunettes-pour-smartphone-intelligentes/dp/B09GFLD2VG/ref=sr_1_6?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1JBG82G1TXAC3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7fCg9ZLkOPGPbEYJhPC8ginptCEIWO3cSo0ykJPzo3HMQsBoj_-mu8v62v0r_PLvA1UyAwdtnOFsErj5gycgfavoV7J-ULuGBmnmWyT97UyYbRXbyeaV6W2ECRliJhk8_D7ankIrfeWmza0EQbAhXjn3sfjVcOa-nNOy9DH41wOks-p4lcXxhUTMvKqzFtV6RMedLnP7Op7pOhA1ZIAa1hnjW3Dj1FjZenk9COx3M_4_8T5YfN9PjuIFB7rAR77xt4vVyNrdfWdj0lvsTDSw_lRMU6t-QFxATZGBXuBdImI.uAFkEPDQtxL4eNFjCvTm13L0lZn2YNSdnYX3F-U8Loo&dib_tag=se&keywords=casque%2Bvr%2Bpour%2Btelephone&qid=1748795709&sprefix=casque%2Bvr%2Bpour%2Btelephone%2Caps%2C327&sr=8-6&th=1,for the most expensive parts you will need base station or lighthouse of vive and tracker (I want to say that it is not obligatory to have them but it is recomended to have a 6dof tracking if your budget is a can se you to use 3dof tracker like for example a slimevr tracker a joycon) you can find some on the site of vive
3. 3D printing:
(the 3d files are based on the free 3d files from bigscreen beyond) for the 3d printing I will give you the stl and cad files in the release part I use 1. 2. 3D disigne for the cad files I am sorry but the cad files can only be opened by 1. 2. 3d disigne from what I know. the 3d files should look like this
